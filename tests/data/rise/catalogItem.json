Ultrasound units were installed near Glen Canyon Dam (at the buoy line) and at the stateline breakwater at Lake Powell. The files include counts of quagga mussels settled on plates, the size of a sub-set of mussels, the dry weight of all biofouling organisms and data obtained from metabarcoding analysis of algae species. The data was used to prepare graphs that were included in the final report.",
